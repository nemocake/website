        "As a newly titled \"vibe coder\" the one thing I've really enjoyed when using Claude is the ambition to learn it instills in me. This ambition has only inspired me to explore ideas I've never thought id be capable of before.",
        "Prior to Claude I wasn't completely unaware of how programming, systems or even computers worked in general but I was still so lost on how most computing structures were built. Being chronically online since a little kid, there's been a handful of occasions where I've wanted to get more technical with my use of computers. At 12 years old I created my own Runescape private server on an old website that hosted RSPS webclients. The site allowed you to choose a specific client base for the game and allowed you to host and edit a server for others to play on. The site only allowed you to control server-sided files and not the client side so you could change the text dialogue of a character, stats of a weapon, or experience rates BUT you couldn't do many of the fun (and arguably more technical) client side programming. This meant no cool custom monsters, custom weapon models or changing combat animations. Although quite a \"boiler templated\" process, it was still a large learning journey in setting up a running server people could connect to, using compiling systems to push updates, and even managing a small online community. Funny enough, the naivety of my 12 year old self became a bit too ambitious with trying to learn programming and began creating my own custom client to excitingly begin exploring custom 3D asset creation....but long story short, I'd eventually download a virus, get RAT-ed, become terrified of malware and slowed down on my online digging and downloading for a short while after.",
        "Fast forward years and I'd still continuously explore more small programming endeavors in similar ways, curiously trying to mess with digital tools, programming languages, on-chain contracts, etc. I'd always get spurts of energy to try and learn more but would have a hard time even knowing what I should be learning. Should I dive into JS, HTML, CSS, C+.... should I learn frontend or backend practices...there was so many interesting aspects of computer science that intersected my hobbies that it was hard to find what to focus on.",
        "Claude has only made me want to understand programming more. The languages, how computers interpolate data, best practices, the whole shebang (pun intended). The idea that Claude could potentially help guide me to gaining a better broad understanding of computers so I could be better informed on what exactly I wanted to drill into, explore and learn.",
        "This led me to asking Claude to act as more of a professor by building out an educational framework that'd work with my current abilities and knowledge.",
        "The best part of Claude (or ML/AI in general) is the adaptability it provides. Rather than creating a rigid learning course tool that already exists for free all over the web, I could create a learning system that Claude updated, refined and adapted to how I was learning, working and processing information. Imagine doing leetcode or any online-lesson that you feel like could use a bit better explaining, more visual examples, or just additional information that'd help you better understand the topic at hand. Well with Claude working in parallel, it allowed for just that, I could give feedback as the lesson plans went on to improve the overall framework of the course. Finish up a Claude generated lesson that didn't seem to explain a topic or term well enough about? Prompt Claude to dive deeper.",
        {"type": "quote", "text": "Well some online courses already provide AI assistants to better explain ideas, so what's different?"},
        "The difference here, is that the learning framework, user interface, and imbedded features ARE ALL ADAPTABLE. You aren't stuck in the corporatized framework built by some arbitrary design team. You get to be the master of the creation and utility. Maybe you want a \"flash-card\" feature that gives you easily reviewable flashcards for important terms that can quickly be studied for definitions or use case examples. Simply explaining that feature structure to Claude can probably get you something close to it! Previous SaaS tools can be redefined to Software as a Seed. Open-source programs that act as bases for others to have Claude or any LLM model build from.",
        {"type": "image", "src": "../assets/images/writings/learningos2.PNG"},
        "Another big benefit to this was expanding on the idea that everyone learns differently, whether that's visually, auditory, hands on examples, flash cards, pop quizzes, or structured note taking. Personal learning processes are SO unique. This is a concept public schooling is always attempting to tackle... \"What are the best ways to creating learning plans that benefit most types of learners?\" This project was made to let me cater to MY preferred learning methods each step of the way.",
        "Since Claude also has root access, it can directly read my projects, files, conversations and insights to better cater lessons for me. There's no amount of questions, preference sliders, or profile tag selections a private company could track that would generate a better customized lesson plan than Claude can with it having access to your entire filebase, context and quarks. Claude can understand your exact stack preferences, coding patterns, project MVPs to better guide you to improving your knowledge base.",
        "This can become a symbiotic relationship. As the saying goes...\"A fool doesn't know what he doesn't know.\" As Claude helps you improve my understandings, I'll only learn more unknowns, leading to future lessons plans! Reverse the Dunning-Kruger effect. There is a grace in being naive today, so long as you possess the ambition to outgrow it by tomorrow.",
        {"type": "image", "src": "../assets/images/writings/learningos3.PNG"},
        "What can go wrong? Well maybe a lot. LLMs in general love to hallucinate, and even occasionally, take shortcuts to skip things. If Claude begins give lessons built around false information, the idea is kind of ruined BUT I'm hopeful most information it'll give will still better my understanding in totality.",
